						For those unfamiliar with vaporwave... well, it's difficult to pin down. 
						Rather than follow a typical formula, the genre’s artists draw inspiration 
						from obscure R&B, funk and soul as much as from the ripples of music that 
						flow through glistening, soft-focus old-school television ads and the 
						ambience of luxury spas. Vaporwave is a sort of nouveau-exotica, 
						evocative and illustrative of dream worlds and fantasy lives; its 
						aesthetics are coded in Japanese text, computer glitches, net art, 
						Italian fashion and silver-spoon penthouses. In short, it takes you 
						elsewhere. And with a wide number of prolific artists, it's never 
						short of new experiences.

						Constructing a home for vaporwave artists, Hong Kong Express’ Dream 
						Catalogue has already put out over fifty releases in the past nine months. 
						I had the pleasure of exchanging a few emails and Twitter messages with 
						its founder and head, himself an anonymous producer. Why anonymous? 
						Much vaporwave is nameless and retains its ethereality in this way; 
						just as magicians do not reveal their tricks, neither do many artists 
						of this few-years-old movement reveal anything about themselves. 
						However, Dream Catalogue's boss was more than happy to provide a set 
						of revelations other than the trivia of name and place: a history of 
						his young label, its development and future, as well as thoughts on 
						vaporwave and music in general.
