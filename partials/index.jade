				For those unfamiliar with vaporwave... well, it's difficult to pin down. 
				Rather than follow a typical formula, the genre’s artists draw inspiration 
				from obscure R&B, funk and soul as much as from the ripples of music that 
				flow through glistening, soft-focus old-school television ads and the 
				ambience of luxury spas. Vaporwave is a sort of nouveau-exotica, 
				evocative and illustrative of dream worlds and fantasy lives; its 
				aesthetics are coded in Japanese text, computer glitches, net art, 
				Italian fashion and silver-spoon penthouses. In short, it takes you 
				elsewhere. And with a wide number of prolific artists, it's never 
				short of new experiences.

				Constructing a home for vaporwave artists, Hong Kong Express’ Dream 
				Catalogue has already put out over fifty releases in the past nine months. 
				I had the pleasure of exchanging a few emails and Twitter messages with 
				its founder and head, himself an anonymous producer. Why anonymous? 
				Much vaporwave is nameless and retains its ethereality in this way; 
				just as magicians do not reveal their tricks, neither do many artists 
				of this few-years-old movement reveal anything about themselves. 
				However, Dream Catalogue's boss was more than happy to provide a set 
				of revelations other than the trivia of name and place: a history of 
				his young label, its development and future, as well as thoughts on 
				vaporwave and music in general.
